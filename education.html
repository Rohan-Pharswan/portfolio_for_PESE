            <h2>Assignment: Movie Review</h2>
            <div class="week-content">
                <p><b>Movie: The Shawshank Redemption</b></p>
                <p>The Shawshank Redemption The Shawshank Redemption is more than just a film—it's a moving portrayal of hope, perseverance, and inner freedom. Based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover. Through his time in Shawshank prison, Andy becomes a symbol of quiet resilience and integrity. His journey is intertwined with that of Ellis "Red" Redding, played masterfully by Morgan Freeman, whose narration adds warmth and wisdom to the story. What makes this movie stand out is its ability to capture the emotional and psychological transformation of its characters. It doesn't rely on action or spectacle—instead, it digs deep into human nature, the value of friendship, and the undying power of trust.</p>
                <p><b>Favourite Dialogue:</b></p>
                <p>"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."</p>
                <p><b>Learning:</b></p>
                <p>The biggest lesson I learned from this movie is to *never lose hope*, even when life seems stuck or unfair. Andy's quiet determination and faith that better days will come reminds me to stay patient and trust the process—even in the darkest of times</p>
